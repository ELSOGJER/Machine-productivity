This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the final inspection machine for finished fabric, comparing the resulting quantities and lengths with the original quantities and lengths, and calculating the first and second grades. The second grade is calculated as a whole and again as a production.
1. The fabric being inspected by the machine is divided into two types: woven and knitted.
2. Each type receives a work order with a specific serial number, such as K03698, which is woven, or W03698, which is woven.
3. All woven results are calculated by weight.
4. All woven results are calculated by length.
